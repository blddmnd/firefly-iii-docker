This repository contains some of the helper scripts you may need when setting up Firefly III using Docker.

## Docker image for Firefly III

The Firefly III Docker image is built [on Azure](https://dev.azure.com/Firefly-III/MainImage/_wiki/wikis/MainImage.wiki/3/Home) and published [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fireflyiii/core). You can find the [Dockerfile](https://dev.azure.com/Firefly-III/_git/MainImage?path=/Dockerfile) on Azure as well. There are several tags available on Docker Hub:

* `fireflyiii/core:latest`  
  The latest version. Will be stable.
* `fireflyiii/core:version-x.x.x`  
  A version tag, frozen to a specific patch version. Old version tags will be removed after about 6 months.
* `fireflyiii/core:version-x.x`  
  A version tag, frozen to a specific minor version. Old version tags will be removed after about 6 months.
* `fireflyiii/core:version-x`  
  A version tag, frozen to a specific major version. Old version tags will be removed after about 6 months.

For daredevils, the following tags are available:

* `fireflyiii/core:develop`  
  The latest development build. May not even boot.
* `fireflyiii/core:alpha`  
  The latest alpha release, if available.
* `fireflyiii/core:beta`.  
  The latest beta release, if available.

## Docker image for the Firefly III Data Importer

The Firefly III Data Importer Docker image is built [on Azure](https://dev.azure.com/Firefly-III/ImportToolImage/_wiki/wikis/ImportToolImage.wiki/4/Home) and published [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fireflyiii/data-importer). You can find the [Dockerfile](https://dev.azure.com/Firefly-III/_git/ImportToolImage?path=/Dockerfile) on Azure. There are several tags available:

* `fireflyiii/data-importer:latest`  
  The latest version. Will be stable.
* `fireflyiii/data-importer:version-x.x.x`  
  A version tag, frozen to a specific patch version. Old version tags will be removed after about 6 months.
* `fireflyiii/data-importer:version-x.x`  
  A version tag, frozen to a specific minor version. Old version tags will be removed after about 6 months.
* `fireflyiii/data-importer:version-x`  
  A version tag, frozen to a specific major version. Old version tags will be removed after about 6 months.


## docker-compose.yml and docker-compose-importer.yml

This repository also contains the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file which you can use to instantly run a version of Firefly III with a MariaDB (aka MySQL) database.

The alternative, [docker-compose-importer.yml](docker-compose-importer.yml) also contains the [Data Importer](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/how-to/data-importer/installation/docker/).

Some people use another database image instead of the provided database. This is entirely up to you of course, but make sure you change the environment variables if you switch away from MySQL or MariaDB.

### Docker and system architectures

The [database image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) provided by [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) may not provide the same system architectures as the [Firefly III image](https://hub.docker.com/r/fireflyiii/core/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated&name=latest) does. On system with a i386-architecture for example this means that Firefly III will run fine, but the provided database will not. Be aware that this may happen to you, although it's a rare occurrence.
